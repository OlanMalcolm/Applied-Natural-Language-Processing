      "1 - ECE: A multifunctional platform based on the microhotplate was developed for applications including a Pirani vacuum gauge, temperature, and gas sensor. It consisted of a tungsten microhotplate and an on-chip operational amplifier. The platform was fabricated in a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. A tungsten plug in standard CMOS process was specially designed as the serpentine resistor for the microhotplate, acting as both heater and thermister. With the sacrificial layer technology, the microhotplate was suspended over the silicon substrate with a 340 nm gap. The on-chip operational amplifier provided a bias current for the microhotplate. This platform has been used to develop different kinds of sensors. The first one was a Pirani vacuum gauge ranging from 10(-1) to 10(5) Pa. The second one was a temperature sensor ranging from -20 to 70 degrees C. The third one was a thermal-conductivity gas sensor, which could distinguish gases with different thermal conductivities in constant gas pressure and environment temperature. In the fourth application, with extra fabrication processes including the deposition of gas-sensitive film, the platform was used as a metal-oxide gas sensor for the detection of gas concentration.\n",

In this study, the performance of the feed forward neural network (FFNN) was compared with radial basis neural network (RBNN) in modelling the productivity of masonry crews. A variety of input factors were incorporated and analysed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate model performance. Research results indicated that the neural computing techniques could be successfully employed in modelling crew productivity. It was also found that successful models could be developed with different combinations of input factors, and several of the models which excluded one or more input factors turned out to be better than the baseline models. Based on the MAPE values obtained for the models, the RBNN technique was found to be better than the FFNN technique, although both slightly overestimated the masons' productivity.\n",

    "# Q2: Classification with CNN [15pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers are used to find patterns by sliding a small kernel window over the input. In computer vision applications, the kernel window slides through and gets multiplied by small regions in an image. In the context of NLP, the kernel slides through and gets multiplied by the embedding vectors of a few words as specified by window size. For looking at sequences of word embeddings, the window has to look at multiple word embeddings in a sequence. The kernel will be rectangular with size window_size x embedding_size. For example, if window size is 3 then the kernel size will be 3 x 500. This essentially represents n-grams in the model. The kernel weights (filter) are multiplied to word embeddings in pairs and summed up to get output values. As the network is being learned, these kernel weights are also being learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs, in the context of NLP, are tasks like spam detection and recognizing patterns and anomalies in small texts. This ability allows them to quickly filter out irrelevant or harmful content. However, CNNs suffer on tasks that depend on a lot of context, like multi-message chats or long documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the power of CNNs by implementing a convolutional neural network with a pre-trained word2vec model for classification similar to the CNN-rand baseline described by [Kim (2014)](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1181.pdf). Although our model differs from the paper, it may still be helpful to review the model section of the paper to get a general overview of the architecture. We will use a pre-trained word2vec model for feasibility of finding the appropriate embeddings. The architecture of our model looks like:\n",

    "# Q3: Classification with RNN [15pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a powerful class of neural networks that are designed to handle sequence prediction problems. RNNs operate by maintaining a hidden state that captures the information of all the previous elements in the sequence. For text data, this means that each word is not looked at in isolation, but rather as part of the overall context provided by the words that came before it. The hidden state is updated at each step of the sequence, which allows the network to make predictions based on all previously seen data. A bi-directional RNN is a slight modification to the vanilla RNN, where it maintains two hidden states, one that captures information from the previous elements, and the other that captures information from the upcoming elements. This usually allows it to perform better since it takes into account past and future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNN's may or may not perform well depending on the task at hand. In the context of Customer Feedback Analysis, RNN's excel at understanding the overall sentiment of a sentence/review. For this example of a review: \"I initially had issues with the product, but their customer service was outstanding, and now I love it!\", an RNN can understand the overall positive sentiment despite the initial negative phrase.\n",
    "However, RNN's may not be appropriate to use for categorizing feedback. For example: In order to categorize customer feedback into 'Product', 'Service', or 'Delivery', RNN's may be overkill. A simple keyword detection approach would suffice for such a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will be using recurrent neural networks for classification. Below is a diagram of our model architecture, **note how the hidden state of the last word in the forward direction and the hidden state of the first word in the reverse direction are both fed into the dense linear layer.** \n",
    "<!---\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/static/text/tutorials/images/bidirectional.png\" width=\"75%\" align=\"center\"></p>\n",
    "-->\n",
    "![title](data/img/RNN.png)\n",
    "**NOTE**: It is important to note that we use the hidden state corresponding to the last word in the forward direction, which isn't necessarily the hidden state of the last time-step. For example if we have 3 sentences of lengths 10, 15 and 20, all 3 sentences will be padded up to 20 tokens during the pre-processing and vectorizing step (which has been implemented in the vectorize_batch( ) function in 3.2). We will be using the hidden state corresponding to the last word in each sentence (which will be $h_{10}^f$, $h_{15}^f$ and $h_{20}^f$ respectively), not the hidden state of the last time-step (which is $h_{20}^f$ for all 3 sentences).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using an embedding layer, followed by a bi-directional RNN layer, and then a linear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Clickbait and Web of Science dataset for this task."

However, for more complex tasks like categorizing emails into specific folders (e.g., 'Work', 'Personal', 'Promotions') based on the content's tone, urgency, and subject matter, traditional NNs might not perform well because they cannot process the sequence and context of words effectively.\n",
