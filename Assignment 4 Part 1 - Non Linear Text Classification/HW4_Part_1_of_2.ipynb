      "1 - ECE: A multifunctional platform based on the microhotplate was developed for applications including a Pirani vacuum gauge, temperature, and gas sensor. It consisted of a tungsten microhotplate and an on-chip operational amplifier. The platform was fabricated in a standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. A tungsten plug in standard CMOS process was specially designed as the serpentine resistor for the microhotplate, acting as both heater and thermister. With the sacrificial layer technology, the microhotplate was suspended over the silicon substrate with a 340 nm gap. The on-chip operational amplifier provided a bias current for the microhotplate. This platform has been used to develop different kinds of sensors. The first one was a Pirani vacuum gauge ranging from 10(-1) to 10(5) Pa. The second one was a temperature sensor ranging from -20 to 70 degrees C. The third one was a thermal-conductivity gas sensor, which could distinguish gases with different thermal conductivities in constant gas pressure and environment temperature. In the fourth application, with extra fabrication processes including the deposition of gas-sensitive film, the platform was used as a metal-oxide gas sensor for the detection of gas concentration.\n",

In this study, the performance of the feed forward neural network (FFNN) was compared with radial basis neural network (RBNN) in modelling the productivity of masonry crews. A variety of input factors were incorporated and analysed. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient (R) were used to evaluate model performance. Research results indicated that the neural computing techniques could be successfully employed in modelling crew productivity. It was also found that successful models could be developed with different combinations of input factors, and several of the models which excluded one or more input factors turned out to be better than the baseline models. Based on the MAPE values obtained for the models, the RBNN technique was found to be better than the FFNN technique, although both slightly overestimated the masons' productivity.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) is a variant of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is able to deal with the vanishing gradient problem that we sometimes encounter in traditional RNNs. The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become smaller and smaller as they backpropagate, leading to difficulties in learning long-term dependencies. LSTM's uses a cell state to remember information over arbitrary time intervals, and a combination of 3 gates, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate, to regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell. By selectively keeping track of the relevant information in the cell state, the LSTM is able to learn useful long-term dependencies. The vanishing gradient problem is also alleviated because gradients are allowed to flow unchanged through the cell state.\n",

    "We will be using a Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) for classification. The architecture of our model looks like :\n",

    "**NOTE**: It is important to note that we use the hidden state corresponding to the last word in the forward direction, which isn't necessarily the hidden state of the last time-step. For example if we have 3 sentences of lengths 10, 15 and 20, all 3 sentences will be padded up to 20 tokens during the pre-processing and vectorizing step (which has been implemented in the vectorize_batch( ) function below). We will be using the hidden state corresponding to the last word in each sentence (which will be\n",

    "\n",
    "A vanilla LSTM approach has a few potential issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It needs to compress all of the necessary information in a source sentence into a fixed-length vector. This may make it difficult for it to cope with long sentences, especially those that are longer than the sentences in the training corpus.\n",
    "2. Lack of selective focus: LSTM's process sequential data step-by-step, but not all parts of the input sequence are equally relevant for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now explore an attention mechanism that offers a solution to both of these issues. Attention allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence at each step, giving more weight to important information. By selectively attending to different parts of the input, the model can capture long-range dependencies and contextual information more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of attention mechanisms that can be applied in NLP problems, but for this homework you will be implementing the Dot-Product Attention technique. It was proposed by [Luong et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025v5), who proposed a Global Attention Model, which would consider the hidden state at each time step. This model computes a variable-length alignment vector $\\alpha$, which learns the relevant contextual information in the input sequence for the task at hand (in our scenario: sentence classification). Given the alignment vector as weights, the context vector is computed as the weighted average of the LSTM hidden states across all timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we will be implementing LSTM with Attention. The model architecture is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./data/images/q2_attention.png\" width=\"75%\" align=\"center\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The paper linked above proposes the Dot-Product Attention technique for a Machine-Translation task, which requires an encoder-decoder architecture (Many-Many). Since we are dealing with a classification problem (which requires a Many-One architecture), the raw alignment scores are computed a little differently.\n",
    "1. The raw alignment scores are computed as $e_{i} =  a(h_{i}, h_{FINAL})$ $\\forall i \\in [1, 2, ... T]$ where $a$ is the alignment model (a dot product operation) and $h_{FINAL} = (h_n^f, h_1^b,)$ is the final hidden state of the LSTM obtained by concatenating the forward hidden state for the last word ($h_n^f$) with the backward hidden state for the first word ($h_1^b$). Also, $h_{i}$ represents the hidden state vector corresponding to the i'th time step, and it's made up of the forward and backward hidden state vectors at the i'th time step $h_{i} = (h_{i}^f, h_{i}^b)$.\n",
    "2. The normalized attention weights are computed as $\\alpha_{i} = \\frac{\\exp e_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^T {\\exp e_{i}}}$.\n",
    "3. The context vector is computed using this formula: $c = \\sum_{i=1}^T \\alpha_i * h_{i}$\n",
    "4. The context vector $c$ should be passed alongside the final hidden state of the LSTM $h_{FINAL} = (h_n^f, h_1^b,)$ to the Context Layer. The context layer is just another linear layer that needs to be initialized. You will need to determine its input and output sizes from the model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to lecture for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be extending the LSTM model and incorporating attention on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then classify the Clickbait and Web of science dataset for this task."

    "BERT base has around 110 million parameters, and BERT large has around 340 million. Due to the sheer size of these models, a couple concerns arose. How can these models be used in production with low latency constraints? How can we avoid expensive GPU servers? How can we make models energy efficient?\n",

This is done through a variety of [techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13116). In this problem, let's explore [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108), a model with 40% less parameters than BERT but is still able to keep 97% of it's language understanding capibilities."

You should see the time nearly halved, yet we were able to retain most of its accuracy because the model is ~1.6x smaller than BERT! Fine-tuning with a distilled model is typically faster and requires fewer computational resources compared to using the full model. This efficiency stems from the smaller size and reduced complexity of distilled models, making them quicker to train and less demanding in terms of memory and processing power."
